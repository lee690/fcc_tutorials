Hey there!

I'm on a coding journey over at FreeCodeCamp, cooking up projects and learning the ropes of development. 
It's like having my own little coding playground! ðŸŽ¢

As I conquer challenges and make things that work (and sometimes break), I'm keeping a digital scrapbook over on GitHub. 
It's where I store my creationsâ€”sort of like a coder's photo album. ðŸ“¸

Hope y'all enjoy!
